# Survey form with React

This was a project to build a survey form in React.

## The problem

I started by adding the form elements that were to be included in my survey. I then divided them in separate components as children to App.js, linking them together with useState hooks. 

A small summary component was added which renders the user input after clicking on the submit button, hiding the form.
